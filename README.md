# Simon-s-Game
This project is a simple web-based version of the classic Simon Game. The game tests your memory skills by presenting a series of color sequences that you need to recall and repeat in the correct order. With each successful level, the sequence length increases, challenging your memory further as the game progresses.

**How to Play**
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A sequence of colors will flash in a specific order. Remember the sequence!
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. With each successful level, the sequence gets longer. Try to keep up and see how many levels you can complete!
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can start again by pressing any key.

**Tools and Technologies**
- HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: For styling and visual design.
- JavaScript (ES6): For game logic and interactivity.
- jQuery: For simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

**This project is part of The App Brewery course curriculum.**
